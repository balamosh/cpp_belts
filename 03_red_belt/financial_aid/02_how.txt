Right before COVID-19 I dropped out of my university where I studied applied mathematics. I had some computer science classes but my knowledge is incomplete and requires to be filled in. I'm working towards finding a job as backend software developer. I know programming languages at an elementary level but it's not enough. My current specialization is FX Artist. I cannnot get a new job in that field because it's a very small and highly competetive industry. I cannot get a job in the new field that I seek because I have no expirience yet and my knowledge is insuficcient. I want to take a course "C++ modern development: red belt" ("Основы разработки на C++: красный пояс") offered by Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Yandex and E-Learning Development Fund.
I believe that the course “C++ modern development: red belt”, will help me to increase my knowledge and will provide me with new job opportunities. Also I intend to pass all the courses from the “C++ modern development Specialization" ("Искусство разработки на современном C++ Specialization"). I’m confident I have enough time to attend the course. I have a strong desire to pass the entire course.

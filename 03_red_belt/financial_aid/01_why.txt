Hello, my name is Vasiliy. I'm forced to apply to you for a financial support. I require to pass a course named "C++ modern development: red belt" ("Основы разработки на C++: красный пояс"). I'm 24 years old. I'm currently trying to change my specialization to software developer from being FX Artist. I'm currently living with my girlfriend who is also unemployed. At the moment, I'm waiting for the results from selection committee of programming school that I proceeded to a couple of month ago. It could help me to get an internship but the results will be available only in 1-2 months and because of that I need a backup plan. I can't afford to continue this course specialization, because the only money available for me right now is what I accumulated while working at my previous job. That money won't last for too long and is enough only for essentials and food. But I need to change my specialization and a new job to afford more. I am confident that the new work will open up new perspectives for me and my girlfriend. All necessary documents confirming my financial standing will be immediately presented up on your request.
